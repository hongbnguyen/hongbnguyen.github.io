        <p class="intro">Below are some demonstrations of the various phenomena and manipulations discussed in the following paper:</p>
        <p class="publication">
          Nguyen, H. B., and van Buren, B. (2023). <strong>May the Force be against you: Better visual sensitivity to speed changes opposite gravity.</strong> <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 49, 1016-1030.</em>

        <p class="description">
          Beyond seemingly lower-level features such as color and motion, 
          visual perception also recovers properties more commonly associated with higher-level 
          thought, as when an upwardly accelerating object is seen not just as moving, 
          but moreover as self-propelled, and resisting the force of gravity. Given past 
          research demonstrating the prioritization of living things in attention and memory, 
          here we hypothesized that observers would be more sensitive to an object's 
          speed changes if those speed changes were opposite to natural gravitational 
          acceleration. Across six experiments, we found that observers were more sensitive 
          to objects' accelerations when they moved upward (when those accelerations were opposite 
          to gravity) and less sensitive to their accelerations when they moved downward 
          (when those accelerations were consistent with gravity). Moreover, 
          observers were more sensitive to objects' decelerations when they moved downward 
          (when those decelerations appeared as 'braking' against gravity), and less sensitive 
          to their decelerations when they moved upward (when those decelerations were consistent 
          with gravity). This greater visual sensitivity to speed changes opposite to gravity is 
          consistent with previous results suggesting that we naturally monitor the world for cues 
          to animacy.

          <h2>Demonstrations</h2>
          <h3>Experiment 1 — Acceleration Detection (Upward vs. Downward)</h3>
          <p>
            In an initial experiment, observers viewed animations featuring single moving objects. 
            After each animation, they reported whether the object accelerated, 
            or remained at a constant speed. We predicted that observers would be more sensitive 
            to the acceleration of upward-moving objects (i.e. when the speed change was opposite 
            to gravity) compared to downward-moving objects (i.e. when the speed change was 
            consistent with gravity).
          </p>

          <p>Observers were better at detecting acceleration for Upward-moving objects than 
            for Downward-moving objects. These results indicate that we are more sensitive 
            to an object's acceleration when it is opposite to the force of gravity, 
            compared to the same acceleration when it is consistent with the force of gravity.

          <h3>Experiment 2 — Acceleration Detection (Upward vs. Horizontal)</h3>
          <p>
            The results of the previous experiment suggest that we are more sensitive 
            to acceleration when it is opposite to normal gravitational acceleration. 
            However, there is an alternate interpretation of these results, which is 
            that they do not reflect greater sensitivity detecting upward acceleration, 
            but rather lower sensitivity to downward acceleration. To determine whether 
            the previous effect was driven by an advantage for seeing acceleration opposite 
            to gravity, and not just by worse performance detecting acceleration consistent 
            with gravity, in Experiment 2 we compared Upward acceleration detection to a new 
            baseline: Horizontal acceleration detection.
          </p>

          <p>
            Observers were better at detecting acceleration for Upward-moving objects than 
            for Horizontally-moving objects. These results indicate that the results of 
            Experiment 1 (greater sensitivity to Upward vs. Downward acceleration) are driven, 
            at least in part, by an advantage for detecting speed changes opposite to typical 
            gravitational speed changes.

          <h3>Experiment 3 — Acceleration Detection (Downward vs. Horizontal)</h3>
          <p>
            Just out of curiosity, we next tested whether another part of the effect 
            in Experiment 1 might have been driven by a disadvantage for gravity-consistent 
            acceleration, by comparing detection of Downward acceleration to detection of 
            Horizontal acceleration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Observers were worse at detecting acceleration for Downward-moving objects 
            than for Horizontally-moving objects. These results indicate that the results 
            of Experiment 1 (greater sensitivity to Upward vs. Downward acceleration) are 
            not driven by a disadvantage for gravity-consistent acceleration.

          <h3>Experiment 4 — Deceleration Detection (Upward vs. Downward)</h3>
          <p>
            The hypothesis that observers are more sensitive to speed changes that 
            oppose gravity makes the reverse prediction for the detection of deceleration. 
            If an upward-moving object decelerates, then this deceleration is attributable 
            to the force of gravity, and observers should be relatively insensitive to this. 
            By contrast, if a downward-moving object decelerates, then this deceleration may 
            be attributed to a 'braking' force resisting gravity, in which case observers 
            should be more sensitive to this. To test this prediction, we next ran a 
            deceleration detection experiment, which was analogous to Experiment 1, 
            except that now observers detected decelerations instead of accelerations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Observers were better at detecting decelerations for Downward-moving objects 
            than for Upward-moving objects. These results indicate that the results of Experiment 1 
            (greater sensitivity to Upward vs. Downward acceleration) were also driven partly by 
            a disadvantage for gravity-consistent acceleration.

          <h3>Experiment 5 — Deceleration Detection (Downward vs. Horizontal)</h3>
          <p>
            To determine whether the previous effect was in part driven by an advantage 
            for seeing deceleration opposite to gravity, in Experiment 5 we compared 
            deceleration detection in a Downward moving condition (which was identical to 
            the Downward moving condition in the previous experiment) to deceleration detection 
            in a new Horizontal baseline condition.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Observers were better at detecting deceleration for Downward-moving objects 
            than for Horizontally-moving objects. These results indicate that the results 
            of Experiment 4 (greater sensitivity to Downward vs. Upward deceleration) are driven, 
            at least in part, by an advantage for detecting speed changes that are opposite 
            to typical gravitational speed changes.

            Experiment 4 might have been driven by a disadvantage for gravity-consistent 
            deceleration, by comparing detection of Upward deceleration to detection of Horizontal 
            deceleration.

          <a href="#" target="_blank">PDF</a>
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          We report a new attentional cueing effect, which shows how 
          attention models the physical force of friction. Most objects we see are in frictive 
          contact with a 'floor', such that clockwise rotation causes rightward movement and 
          counterclockwise rotation leftward movement. Is this regularity encoded in spatial 
          orienting responses? In Experiment 1, seeing a clockwise-rotating 'wheel' produced 
          faster responses to subsequent targets appearing on the right vs. left (and vice versa 
          for counterclockwise rotation). Thus, when viewing a lone rotating wheel, we orient 
          attention toward where we predict it will move next, assuming frictive floor contact. 
          But what happens if the rotating wheel is seen touching another visible surface? 
          In Experiment 2, rotational cueing was stronger for wheels touching a visible floor, 
          was abolished for wheels near but not touching another surface, and reversed for wheels 
          touching a ceiling. We conclude that the visual system makes an assumption of frictive 
          floor contact, and rapidly analyzes visual cues to frictive contact with other surfaces, 
          in order to orient attention toward where objects are likely to move next.

          <h2>Demonstrations</h2>
          <h3>Experiment 1 — Rotating objects cue spatial attention</h3>
          <p>
            When we see an object, it is usually sitting on a surface beneath it, and it is 
            usually in frictive contact with that surface. If these physical regularities are wired 
            into the operation of visual attention, then viewing an isolated rotating stimulus 
            might automatically cue spatial attention in the direction the object would move if 
            in frictive contact with a 'floor'. To test this, we asked subjects to complete a 
            speeded letter identification task. We predicted that a preceding clockwise-rotating 
            wheel might produce faster responses to targets appearing on the right (vs. left), 
            and that a counterclockwise-rotating wheel might produce faster responses to targets 
            appearing on the left (vs. right).
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, Clockwise rotation produced faster response times to targets appearing 
            on the right vs. left, and Counterclockwise rotation produced faster response times 
            to targets on the left vs. right. Thus, a lone stationary rotating object orients 
            spatial attention toward where it would normally move assuming contact with a <em>frictive 
              floor</em>.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3>Experiment 2 — Reversal of the cueing effect by contact with a 'ceiling'</h3>
          <p>
            In Experiment 1, the rotating wheel was always presented alone, without any other 
            surfaces visible. It nevertheless produced a strong spatial orienting effect, 
            in the direction the wheel would move if it were in frictive contact with a floor 
            beneath it. One possibility is that rotating objects always orient spatial attention 
            in a way which assumes frictive contact with a floor. (After all, this assumption is 
            consistent with the vast majority of objects that we see.) But another possibility is 
            that, when we see a rotating object make visible contact with another surface, 
            that this might modulate how the rotating object orients attention, in a way which 
            is consistent with how the wheel *should* move, given frictive contact with that 
            surface. In Experiment 2, we investigated how the rotation cueing effect (computed as 
            [RT for letters on the side of the wheel incongruent with terrestrial-rolling] - 
            [RT for letters on the side of the wheel congruent with terrestrial-rolling] - 
            [RT for letters on the side of the wheel congruent with terrestrial-rolling]) is 
            influenced by seeing the wheel touch another visible surface (a horizontal line). 
            If the visual system assumes that contact between visible surfaces is frictive, 
            then a wheel touching a visible surface might produce a stronger cueing effect than 
            a wheel slightly separated from that surface. Moreover, the cueing effect might <em>reverse</em> 
            for a rotating wheel seen touching a 'ceiling' (imagine painting your ceiling with 
            a paint roller; here, clockwise rotation is associated with <em>leftward</em> movement).
          </p>

          <p>
            As you can see, in the Floor-Touching condition, subjects again responded faster 
            to letters located congruently with the direction the wheel would move if in frictive 
            contact with a floor vs. located incongruently. In contrast, in the Floor-Not Touching 
            condition, the cueing effect was abolished, with equally fast RTs for letters located 
            congruently with the direction the wheel would move if in frictive contact with a floor 
            vs. located incongruently. Strikingly, on Ceiling-Touching trials, the cueing pattern 
            reversed! Now subjects responded faster to targets that were incongruent with 
            terrestrial rolling vs. congruent. On Ceiling-Not Touching trials, there was no 
            reliable cueing effect. From these results, we conclude that, when other surfaces are 
            visible rotating objects orient attention in a way that integrates information about 
            whether objects appear to be in contact with those surfaces.
