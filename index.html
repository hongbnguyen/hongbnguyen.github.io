        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Hong B. Nguyen, a vision scientist who studies how surprisingly sophisticated implicit knowledge is quietly woven into how we perceive patterns of light landing on our retinas.</p>
        
        <p>In my research, I have discovered that the visual system makes unconscious assumptions about the seemingly invisible physical forces (such as gravity and friction) acting on objects, in order to predict whether they will change speed, and where they will move. I have also found evidence that the visual system automatically picks up on subtle visual cues to others’ intentions (e.g. that a shape is ‘chasing’ another shape, or that a facial expression signals ‘mischievous’ intent). A third branch of my research investigates how the mechanics of visual attention and information acquisition interact with higher-level cognitive processes in more complex tasks, such as navigating a webpage, or inspecting an artwork in order to have an aesthetic experience.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, my work supports two important conclusions — that fast, automatic visual processing is “smarter” than we typically give it credit for, and that seemingly simple acts of looking and seeing provide a rich foundation for higher-level thought.</p>
