        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Hong B. Nguyen, a vision scientist who studies how our visual system quietly weaves physics and psychology into the way we see the world. I investigate how seemingly simple acts of looking—like watching a wheel spin or a shape move across a screen—reveal deeply ingrained assumptions about forces, goals, and other causal structures that shape perception long before we start reasoning about them.</p>

        <p>I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in Psychology at The New School for Social Research, where I investigate how people's visual systems build rich causal and social models of the world — often before we've had time to think.</p>

        <p>My research shows that our visual system is a lot smarter than we give it credit for. For example, I've discovered that when you watch a spinning wheel, your visual system automatically assumes there's friction and a floor involved, and starts predicting where the wheel will roll next — even if you're not paying attention. Similarly, we're exceptionally good at noticing objects that move against gravity (as any horror movie director already knows), and we have a curious fondness for simple shapes that act like they have goals — like a dart turning toward its target. These perceptual quirks reveal how deeply our knowledge of physics and minds is embedded in the way we see.</p>

        <p>Beyond the lab, I love designing experiments that blur the boundaries between vision science, aesthetics, and technology. My work on “attentional transplants,” for instance, shows that how you move your eyes while exploring a landscape can make other people like the same scene more. I've also explored how facial expressions signal playful intent, why shiny things sound “high-pitched,” and how our perceptual biases develop across different cultures and environments.</p>
