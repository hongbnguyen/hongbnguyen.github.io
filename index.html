        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Hong B. Nguyen, a vision scientist who studies how our visual system quietly weaves physics and psychology into perception. I investigate how simple acts of looking—like watching a wheel spin or a shape glide across a screen—reveal deep, automatic assumptions about forces, goals, and causality that shape perception before we ever start to think.</p>

        <p>I'm finishing my Ph.D. in Psychology at The New School for Social Research, where I study how people's visual systems build intuitive models of the physical and social world. My research shows that our visual system is remarkably sophisticated: it predicts how objects will roll, fall, or act—often without our awareness. We're drawn to motion that defies gravity, and even to simple shapes that seem to have intentions.</p>

        <p>Beyond the lab, I design experiments that blur the boundaries between perception, aesthetics, and technology. In one project, "attentional transplants," I found that how you look at a scene can make others like it more. I've also explored how facial expressions convey playful intent, why shiny things sound "high-pitched," and how perceptual biases differ across cultures.</p>
